# Digital-library-PC-monitoring-system
The Digital Library PC Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to help students check the availability of computers in the digital library before physically going there.  The main goal of this project is to save students’ time by displaying the real-time status of library PCs directly on the official Student ERP / Library portal.
